## 1. Introduction

Wisblock is an amazing product built by RAK company for IoT industry. It can build circuits like building blocks quickly to realize your idea, and through high-speed connectors and fasteners interconnection, it can directly compose the reliable industrial products.

Wisblock consists of Wisbase board, Wiscore board, and WisIO board.

RAK5005-O is the Wisbase board which can be connected with Wiscore and WisIO through the connector of the board, and provides direct databus interconnection. Wisbase module also integrates the power supply circuit to realize low power battery power supply. In order to facilitate users, Wisbase has reserved USB ports, indicator lights, keys and extended IO interfaces.

RAK4631 is the Wiscore board which consists of nRF52840 and SX1262. It supports LoRa and BLE functions, and supply a rich resource MCU so that you can program it if you want.

Wisblock is not only functional testability product in product development verification stage, but also industrial products oriented to mass production. It uses a high-speed connector to ensure the integrity of the signal. At the same time, it is equipped with fastening screw, which can be used in vibration environment. And Wisblock can be used reliably in various civil and industrial scenarios through rigorous reliability tests.

Wisblock uses a compact stacked hardware design, which integrates various computing, connecting and sensor circuits in the size of 60*30mm. The compact size makes it easy for users to build in various customized housings to achieve complete products. RAK also have a series of housings for Wisblock modules, which can meet the requirements of various protection levels.

## 2. Safety information

Please read the following items carefully so that Wisblock can be used safely.

### 2.1 Hardware

![image-20200703120054258](assets/image-20200703120054258.png)



### 4.2 Install in Linux

In Linux, there is no install process actually, just a process of uncompression, then you can open Arduino IDE successfully.



### 4.3 Install in Mac OS X

In Mac OS X, it is almost same with Linux, there is no install process actually, just a process of uncompression, then you can open Arduino IDE successfully.



### 4.4 Open Arduino IDE

![image-20200703120123062](assets/image-20200703120123062.png)

As you see, Arduino IDE has mainly 5 parts:

1) IDE option menu

You can configure some general parameters such as the serial port, the board information, the libraries, the edit parameters, and so on.

2) Operating buttons

You can verify/compile source code, upload the compiled code into Wisblock, open a new Arduino IDE window, open an exist application, or save the current application. 

![image-20200703120140901](assets/image-20200703120140901.png)



3) Code area

You can edit the source code which will be compiled and uploaded into Wisblock later in this area.

4) State area

5) Output message area

You can see the output message in this area, no matter failed information and success information.



## 5. Configuration On Arduino IDE

Once Arduino IDE has been installed successfully, and you've understood the mainly parts of Arduino IDE, we can do some configuration changes on Arduino IDE so that it can be adapted to Wisblock.

We use https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_nRF52_Arduino and do as below:

- Open Arduino IDE

- Go into Preferences

  ![image-20200702170623007](assets/image-20200702170623007.png)

- Add https://www.adafruit.com/package_adafruit_index.json as an 'Additional Board Manager URL'

  ![image-20200702170822034](assets/image-20200702170822034.png)

- Restart the Arduino IDE

- Open the Boards Manager from the Tools -> Board menu

  ![image-20200702171102982](assets/image-20200702171102982.png)

- Search and install "Adafruit nRF52" as the following image shows, and install it. It is the BSP actually.

  ![image-20200702171813125](assets/image-20200702171813125.png)

- Once the BSP is installed, select 'Nordic nRF52840DK(PCA10056)' from Tools -> Board -> Adafruit nRF52 Boards, which will update your system config to use the right compiler and settings for the nRF52840.

  ![image-20200702173222325](assets/image-20200702173222325.png)

- Replace the pin map in Adafruit library with RAK header. You can download the RAK header file from https://bitbucket.org/Fomi-RAK/wisblock-rak4630-development/src/master/bsp/variants.h , and copy it to the following folder instead of the original header file:

  - macOS : `~/Library/Arduino15/packages/adafruit/hardware/nrf52/0.20.1/variants/pca10056/`
  - Linux : `~/.arduino15/packages/adafruit/hardware/nrf52/0.20.1/variants/pca10056/`
  - Windows: `%APPDATA%\Local\Arduino15\packages\adafruit\hardware\nrf52\0.20.1\variants\pca10056\`

  OK, we've configured Arduino IDE correctly and install the BSP successfully!

## 6. Load Examples

RAK has supplied many examples source code on Github for Wisblock:

https://bitbucket.org/Fomi-RAK/wisblock-rak4630-development/src/master/examples/

**(图片, examples目录)**



You can use Wisblock directly or make their customized code according to these examples source code. What you need to do is just to load one of these examples into Arduino IDE by opening a .ino file in RAK examples, in this document, we use "ble_proximity_sensing.ino":

![image-20200702191428103](assets/image-20200702191428103.png)

Now, we can compile it directly according to the section 7, or do some customized code before compiling it If you want.

About customization code, you can have a look at the section 9 for more details.



## 7. Compiling Project

The compiling process is very easy, what you need to do is just to click the Verify/Compile button on Arduino IDE:

![image-20200703120229579](assets/image-20200703120229579.png)

Then it will start to compile:

![image-20200702191717737](assets/image-20200702191717737.png)

After compiling successfully, you can see some information in the output message area, and the state is "Done compiling":

**(图片, Arduino IDE compile output information)**

![image-20200702191352945](assets/image-20200702191352945.png)

Now, you can connect your Wisblock hardware with your PC, and upload the code into it.

## 8. Uploading to Wisblock

Before uploading, please make sure that your Wisblock hardware has been connected with your PC correctly, and your PC has recognized Wisblock hardware successfully. If it is, you can select the port now as the following image shows:
